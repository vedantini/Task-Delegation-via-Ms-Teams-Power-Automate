# Task-Delegation-via-Ms-Teams-Power-Automate
Version of a task delegation automation I implemented in my previous workplace using Teams and Power Automate.


This is the link to the team to check how how you can use Power Automate with sharepoint and flows to assist in Project Managemnt from Status of task, Resouces assigned to the task, Vital documents and steps in the task as well as email attachments and QA/UAT test status to ensure the successful deployment/completion of the task in a transperent approach.
